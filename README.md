# GifTastic

## Homework Assignment 6 at the Coding Bootcamp at UCI
### This assigment was our first attempt at implementing an API in one of our own projects
## This web app utilizes the Giphy API

* Users input their favorite athlete in the text form
* This form generates a button with the user's athlete's name assigned as a value
* Once clicked, JQuery grabs value from button and makes an AJAX call
* Receives response from Giphy API and appends the top 10 images from the response to the DOM
